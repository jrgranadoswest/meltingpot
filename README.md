## Background
MeltingPot is a mobile app targeted at helping users learn and practice languages, whether they are beginners or native speakers. The purpose of the app is to allow users to freely communicate with other individuals using the same foreign language in their community, via public posts which anyone can see and upvote or downvote. Another intention of the app was to allow people to find others interested in their shared or newly found culture via community posts. Helpful language assistance such as english translations of unclear posts allow new learners to make the most of the app.


## Future tasks
- Location Services: Allowing users to change the overall range/distance of those they interact with to better reflect their current location or a location of their choice. (Example: Interacting with Spanish speakers in your local area or interacting with Spanish speakers who live in a Spanish-speaking country)
- One-on-One Interaction: One of the features that many language apps lack is one that allows personal interaction between individuals. We hope to implement a feature like this in the future to allow a more personal experience for users of the app. 
- UI Language Matching: Our app is currently intended for users in the United States (a primarily English-speaking country). We would like to edit our UI to change depending on the individual user's native language, leading to a smoother user experience.
